# CDN

This is a storage system for images, JavaScript, HTML, and other code that I plan to use in Astrarune or other projects. I call it example.lib because it functions like a library of reusable code and assets. While it’s referred to as a “CDN,” it isn’t an actual content delivery network—it’s just a centralized place to keep all the files I might need across different projects. This way, I can organize my scripts, styles, and images in one place, making it easier to manage updates, maintain consistency, and quickly access the resources I need for development.

Hope this clears any future confusion.
